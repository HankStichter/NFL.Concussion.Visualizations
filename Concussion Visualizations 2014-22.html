    <h1>Visualizing Concussion Data from 2014-2022</h1>
    <p>While player safety has always been a hot-button issue in the NFL, the topic of concussions and head injuries has taken center stage over 
      the last decade. Both the NFL and the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) bring solutions to the table but they do not necessarily see eye to 
      eye on all of them, leaving room for debate and analysis. These visualizations aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of concussion 
      trends and foster more informed discussions around player safety.</p>
    
      <p>Guardian Caps (an outer layer of padding for helmets that reduces the impact of hits to the head) are one of the most divisive topics in 
      concussion prevention. Players are generally opposed to wearing the Caps due to their unappealing style and hindrance to functionality.</p>
    
      <p>Starting in 2022, the NFL required certain position groups (offensive linemen, tight ends, runningbacks, defensive linemen, and 
      linebackers) to wear Guardian Caps during full-contact practices. These positions were selected as they are the positions that see the 
      most contact to the head on a play-by-play basis. However, this visualization demonstrates that these position groups are not necessarily 
      the ones receiving the most concussions. Hover over positions or position groups to view the total number of concussions, or select a 
      position group to pull up a bar chart of the positions within that group. Area and color in the tree diagram are indicative of concussion 
      numbers, with larger area and darker shading representing a greater number.</p>
    
      <div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1733327367322' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Concussions by Position 2014-22 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Co&#47;ConcussionDataFinalProject&#47;DBConcussionsbyPositions&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='ConcussionDataFinalProject&#47;DBConcussionsbyPositions' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Co&#47;ConcussionDataFinalProject&#47;DBConcussionsbyPositions&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1733327367322');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='800px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='800px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='727px';}                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>
    
      <p>Another point of discussion regarding player safety is the lengthening of the NFL season from 17 games to 18. Owners and league officials 
      would like to lengthen the season for financial reasons, but players generally do not want this citing safety concerns. In addition to this, 
      the season length was just lengthened to 17 games from 16 games starting in the 2021-22 season. </p>
    
      <p>This visualization takes a look at various periods of time over the course of a season or seasons in which concussions concur. Despite 
      concussions being lower in 2021-22 (the first season with a 17-game schedule) than in several past years, the heat map and donut chart 
      both show a greater number of concussions occurring at the end of the season. This may indicate that the accumulated hits players incur 
      during the season can lead to more head injuries the longer the season progresses, thus being an argument against lengthening the season. 
      For a more in-depth look, hover over the data to find out the number of concussions for a given time.</p>
    
      <div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1733327891349' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Concussions by Time of Occurance 2014-22 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Co&#47;ConcussionDataFinalProject&#47;DBConcussionsbyTimeofOccurance&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='ConcussionDataFinalProject&#47;DBConcussionsbyTimeofOccurance' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Co&#47;ConcussionDataFinalProject&#47;DBConcussionsbyTimeofOccurance&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1733327891349');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='800px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='800px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='1027px';}                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>
    
      <p>**Note that weeks 17, 18, and playoffs are omitted from the heat map, as well as January for the donut chart. This is because most 
      seasons had no data for those times, making it difficult to compare and draw conclusions.</p>
    
      <p>NFL teams use a combination of strength and conditioning and full contact practices to prepare players for the intensity of the NFL season. 
      While not as widely talked about as Guardian Caps or season length, team-specific methods for player conditioning could play an important 
      role in concussion prevention. Many teams may already be taking the right steps in this area and may not even know it. A more pessimistic 
      look is that some teams may not properly report concussions at the same frequency, whether intentional or not. Both of these factors would 
      be of interest to the NFL and NFLPA as they could take methods from well-conditioned teams and apply them to the rest of the league, or they 
      can crack down on teams failing to report concussions.</p>
    
      <p>Use this visualization to see how many concussions each team has accrued over this span. Hovering over a team, whether on the map or the 
      horizontal bar chart, will highlight it in other places as well. Selecting a team from the menu will lock on to it. Teams on the map are 
      placed in their geographical locations, with the size of the circle corresponding to the number of concussions. Color for the map is based 
      on the team color.</p>

      <p>As with many datasets and visualizations, uncertainties can arise and should be addressed in order to maintain ethical standards and 
      demonstrate a thorough knowledge and examination of the subject. In this instance, the primary root of uncertainty is how concussions in 
      the dataset are logged. The NFL does not have public concussion data available so data was scraped from missed game reports. For this 
      reason, the number of concussions is really number of concussions leading to games missed. Additionally, while the missed game reports 
      were a great tool, they were lacking in other details such as positions and date of initial injury and so this data needed to be 
      supplemented from other sources. This could lead to slightly less concussions being reported in the visuals as players who received 
      concussions in back-to-back weeks may be listed as only one incident due to the nature or the data.</p>
    
      <p>Despite not wanting uncertainties in the data, knowing where uncertainties arise can lead to exciting future work. Having more accurate 
      data on time missed by a player due to a concussion, or knowing how long symptoms continued after the initial injury could make for 
      interesting visualizations dealing with the severity of concussions based on things looked at here such as when it occurs or the position 
      of the player. On a much more ambitious note, biomechanical data showing how players tackle could show what kinds of hits and plays result 
      in a higher rate of concussions and could make for some very insightful visualizations. The NFL has even started to take action on this 
      front, with the implementation of a new kickoff rule this season aimed at eliminating concussions from that stage of the game.</p>
